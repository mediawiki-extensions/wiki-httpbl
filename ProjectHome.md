# Introduction #
**What is [http:BL](http://www.projecthoneypot.org?rf=39586)?**
> [Http:BL](http://www.projecthoneypot.org?rf=39586) is a way for website administrators to take advantage of the data generated by [Project Honey Pot](http://www.projecthoneypot.org?rf=39586) and keep malicious or suspicious IPs off their websites. The service works by publishing DNS records for IPs we have seen conducting suspicious or malicious behavior online. Website administrators can then use this data in order to restrict access to their web servers for these IPs.
